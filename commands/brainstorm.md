## Topic
$ARGUMENTS

## MCP Helpers (Brain + Memory)

### 🧠 Gemini-Bridge (Brain) — Deep Reasoning
Use for complex analysis, architecture decisions, and creative problem-solving:
```
mcp_gemini-bridge_consult_gemini(query="Analyze approaches for [topic] considering trade-offs...", directory=".")
```

### 📚 Context7 (Memory) — Documentation Lookup
Use for up-to-date library docs and best practices:
```
mcp_context7_resolve-library-id(libraryName="react", query="state management patterns")
mcp_context7_query-docs(libraryId="/vercel/next.js", query="app router best practices")
```

## Brainstorming Process

### 1. Clarify Context
- What problem are we solving?
- Who is the target user?
- What constraints exist?

### 2. Diverge (Generate Many Ideas)
Use SCAMPER technique:
- **S**ubstitute — What can be replaced?
- **C**ombine — What can be merged?
- **A**dapt — What can be borrowed?
- **M**odify — What can be changed?
- **P**ut to other uses — New applications?
- **E**liminate — What can be removed?
- **R**everse — What if we did the opposite?

### 3. Organize by Theme
Group related ideas together.

### 4. Evaluate
| Idea | Feasibility | Impact | Effort |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| ... | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High |

### 5. Recommend Top 3
Highlight the most promising ideas with rationale.
